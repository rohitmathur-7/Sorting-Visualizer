# Sorting-Visualizer: https://sorting-visualizer-site.netlify.app/
This is a Website where we can visualize different sorting algorithms.

Functionalities -

1)We can Visualize algorithms like-
-Merge Sort
-Selection Sort
-Insertion Sort
-Bubble Sort
-Quick Sort

2)We can also change the size of the array that we want to sort!

3)We can change the speed while the sorting process is going on, so that we can visualize the algorithm better!
